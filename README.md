# Imdb-review-based-sentiment-analysis
A machine learning project on sentiment analysis using Imdb movie reviews.


# Introduction
Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.Sentiment analysis of a movie review can rate how positive or negative a movie review is and hence the overall rating for a movie. Therefore, the process of understanding if a review is positive or negative can be automated as the machine learns through training and testing the data.


# About the dataset
The dataset contains a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. The dataset can be used for binary classification.It conatins reviews of different movies in text format,each review in a folder.

# Toolkit
1) Logistic regression:This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring.Logistic regression is used to solve classification problems, and the most common use case is binary logistic regression, where the outcome is binary (yes or no).In this project,logistuc regression classifies the review of the movies into postive or negative reviews.
2) Naive Bayes:Na√Øve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions. It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.Here,we have used Bernoulli naive bayes model.BernoulliNB implements the naive Bayes training and classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions; i.e., there may be multiple features but each one is assumed to be a binary-valued (Bernoulli, boolean) variable.
